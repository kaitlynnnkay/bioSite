            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Born August 9, 1991, Nicholas Dawson has lived many chapters in his almost 34 years. His life began in Columbia, Maryland. From there, Nick’s family bounced back and forth over the years between the D.C. area and Bellevue, NE. It was in Bellevue that Nick met his now wife (me!). After high school, and another move back to D.C., Nick enlisted in the Air Force.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Bace in Dayton, OH, for his entire four-year stint, Dawson adopted the first of his dogs, Guinness. After re-connecting with future spouse, Nick, yet again, relocated to Nebraska. Then came the marriage, a second dog adoption (welcome to the family, Kona!), and a baby (love you, DJ!).</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Though he can most often be found in his living room attempting to play the PS5 while wrangling his 10 month old son and two dogs, Nick Dawson is, undoubtedly, a man of varying interests. When life allows, Nick routinely engages in worldwide travel, tiki culture, all major sports fandoms, and Twitter doom scrolling (if that counts as an interest).</p>
            <br>
            <p>His most time-consuming hobby, though, is his role as the Steward of the Nebraska Blues chapter of the Chelsea in America organization; an interest that has taken him to London, Orlando, and mostly, a local pub for 6am soccer matches. Nick’s role within the Chelsea in America organization is born of his love for Chelsea Foot Club, an English Premier League team.</p>
