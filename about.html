          <h2 class="h2-styled">Personal Life</h2>
          <p>Nicholas Dawson was born in the year 1991 in Columbia, Maryland to his parents, Dan and Cheryl Dawson. Like many of his namesake, he goes by "Nick" for short, or "Nic" if you are his mom. The oldest of two children, Nick had a typical middle-class, nuclear-family upbringing. His dad's work for the DIA was the biggest catalyst of abnormality, causing the family to move back-and-forth from D.C. to Offut Air Force Base numerous time during his childhood and adolescence.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Nick was raised to have an intense, arguably unhealthy, love for sports. The prime focus for this love was the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Nick, his dad, and his younger sister would attend as many games as possible. Though college and professional football were the main intros to sports for Nick, he has an encyclopedic knowledge on most major sports.</p>
          <br>
          <p>While attending high school in Bellevue, NE, Nick met me, his bride-to-be. It wasnâ€™t until ten years later, though, that we became an item and got married. For the first seven years of the marriage, Nick had a lovely family of four: him, his wife, and their two dogs, Guinness and Kona. In late 2024, Nick and his wife welcomed their son, DJ, to round out their family unit.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="h2-styled">Professional Life</h2>
          <p>A fundamental part of Nick's personality is his mindset on work. Nick is a true non-American in the way that he views work as a means to live life, rather than a key asset in his life. However, he understands it's still probably worth mentioning.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To keep it brief, in honor of Nick, his professional career started as an Airmen who worked in Contracting and Procurement. In his post-military career, he has continued working in the contracting field, where he is now a supervisor for a Midwest-based technology company. As a supervisor, he prides himself on being truly team and people-focused.</p>
